**Step 2:** Install testing packages

We are using Jest and Cypress to test our application, and you need to install both of them to get our tests working. First, install the testing packages by typing:
`npm install`

### Running Tests
We have two different types of tests, unit tests and end to end tests.

Our unit tests are done with Jest. To go through all unit tests, run the command

`npm run test-unit`


Our end to end tests are done with Cypress. To go through each of these tests, run the command

`npm run test-e2e`
